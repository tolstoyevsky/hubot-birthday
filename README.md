# hubot-happy-birthder

Hubot script for writing birthday messages to users. It uses [Tenor](https://tenor.com) GIFs to make the messages more lively.

## Features

* Asks freshmen to specify their date birth and reminds them about it if they ignore this request for some reason.
* Fetches a random GIF from [Tenor](https://tenor.com) before writing a birthday message to a birthday boy/girl. The `TENOR_SEARCH_TERM` environment variable stores a comma separated list of the tags which will be used when fetching GIFs. By default, the value of the variable is [thesimpsonsbirthday](https://tenor.com/search/thesimpsonsbirthday),[futuramabirthday](https://tenor.com/search/futuramabirthday),[rickandmortybirthday](https://tenor.com/search/rickandmortybirthday),[tmntbirthday](https://tenor.com/search/tmntbirthday),[harrypotterbirthday](https://tenor.com/search/harrypotterbirthday).
* Writes birthday messages to `#general`.
* Reminds users of the upcoming birthdays one day and a few days in advance. It's possible to specify how long before the event occurs the reminder should be triggered.
* Provides fault tolerance:
  * if Tenor is for some reason unavailable right now, the script will try to request it a number of times with delays;
  * if all the requests failed, users will receive their birthday messages anyway.
* Creates private channels in advance and invites all the users to the channels except the birthday boys/girls for the purpose of discussing the presents for them. Expired channels are automatically removed.

## Prerequisites

* The bot must be in the channel specified via the `BIRTHDAY_LOGGING_CHANNEL` environment variable.
* The bot has to have `view-full-other-user-info` permission.
